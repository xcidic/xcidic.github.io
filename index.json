	"content": " Angular Team Endorsed Special thanks to Igor Minar, lead on the Angular team, for reviewing, contributing feedback, and entrusting me to shepherd this guide.\nPurpose Opinionated Angular style guide for teams by @john_papa\nIf you are looking for an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring Angular applications, then step right in. These styles are based on my development experience with Angular, presentations, Pluralsight training courses and working in teams.\nThe purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance on building Angular applications by showing the conventions I use and, more importantly, why I choose them.\n If you like this guide, check out my Angular Patterns: Clean Code course at Pluralsight which is a companion to this guide.\n \nCommunity Awesomeness and Credit Never work in a vacuum. I find that the Angular community is an incredible group who are passionate about sharing experiences. As such, Angular expert Todd Motto and I have collaborated on many styles and conventions. We agree on most, and some we diverge. I encourage you to check out Todd\u0026rsquo;s guidelines to get a sense for his approach and how it compares.\nMany of my styles have been from the many pair programming sessions Ward Bell and I have had. My friend Ward has certainly helped influence the ultimate evolution of this guide.\nSee the Styles in a Sample App While this guide explains the what, why and how, I find it helpful to see them in practice. This guide is accompanied by a sample application that follows these styles and patterns. You can find the sample application (named modular) here in the modular folder. Feel free to grab it, clone it, or fork it. Instructions on running it are in its readme.\nTranslations Translations of this Angular style guide are maintained by the community and can be found here.\nTable of Contents  Single Responsibility IIFE Modules Controllers Services Factories Data Services Directives Resolving Promises Manual Annotating for Dependency Injection Minification and Annotation Exception Handling Naming Application Structure LIFT Principle Application Structure Modularity Startup Logic Angular $ Wrapper Services Testing Animations Comments JSHint JSCS Constants File Templates and Snippets Yeoman Generator Routing Task Automation Filters Angular Docs  "

	"content": " Single Responsibility Rule of 1 [Style Y001]  Define 1 component per file, recommended to be less than 400 lines of code.  Why?: One component per file promotes easier unit testing and mocking.\nWhy?: One component per file makes it far easier to read, maintain, and avoid collisions with teams in source control.\nWhy?: One component per file avoids hidden bugs that often arise when combining components in a file where they may share variables, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.\nThe following example defines the app module and its dependencies, defines a controller, and defines a factory all in the same file.\n/* avoid */ angular .module('app', ['ngRoute']) .controller('SomeController', SomeController) .factory('someFactory', someFactory); function SomeController() { } function someFactory() { }  The same components are now separated into their own files.\n/* recommended */ // app.module.js angular .module('app', ['ngRoute']);  /* recommended */ // some.controller.js angular .module('app') .controller('SomeController', SomeController); function SomeController() { }  /* recommended */ // some.factory.js angular .module('app') .factory('someFactory', someFactory); function someFactory() { }  Back to Table of Contents\nSmall Functions [Style Y002]  Define small functions, no more than 75 LOC (less is better).  Why?: Small functions are easier to test, especially when they do one thing and serve one purpose.\nWhy?: Small functions promote reuse.\nWhy?: Small functions are easier to read.\nWhy?: Small functions are easier to maintain.\nWhy?: Small functions help avoid hidden bugs that come with large functions that share variables with external scope, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.\nBack to Table of Contents\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " IIFE JavaScript Scopes [Style Y010]  Wrap Angular components in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).  Why?: An IIFE removes variables from the global scope. This helps prevent variables and function declarations from living longer than expected in the global scope, which also helps avoid variable collisions.\nWhy?: When your code is minified and bundled into a single file for deployment to a production server, you could have collisions of variables and many global variables. An IIFE protects you against both of these by providing variable scope for each file.\n/* avoid */ // logger.js angular .module('app') .factory('logger', logger); // logger function is added as a global variable function logger() { } // storage.js angular .module('app') .factory('storage', storage); // storage function is added as a global variable function storage() { }  /** * recommended * * no globals are left behind */ // logger.js (function() { 'use strict'; angular .module('app') .factory('logger', logger); function logger() { } })(); // storage.js (function() { 'use strict'; angular .module('app') .factory('storage', storage); function storage() { } })();  OR…. invocation inside parentheses. This is recomended in MEANJS.\n // logger.js (function() { 'use strict'; angular .module('app') .factory('logger', logger); function logger() { } }()); // storage.js (function() { 'use strict'; angular .module('app') .factory('storage', storage); function storage() { } }());   Note: For brevity only, the rest of the examples in this guide may omit the IIFE syntax.\n Note: IIFE\u0026rsquo;s prevent test code from reaching private members like regular expressions or helper functions which are often good to unit test directly on their own. However you can test these through accessible members or by exposing them through their own component. For example placing helper functions, regular expressions or constants in their own factory or constant.\n  Back to Table of Contents\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " Modules Avoid Naming Collisions [Style Y020]  Use unique naming conventions with separators for sub-modules.  Why?: Unique names help avoid module name collisions. Separators help define modules and their submodule hierarchy. For example app may be your root module while app.dashboard and app.users may be modules that are used as dependencies of app.\nDefinitions (aka Setters) [Style Y021]  Declare modules without a variable using the setter syntax.  Why?: With 1 component per file, there is rarely a need to introduce a variable for the module.\n/* avoid */ var app = angular.module('app', [ 'ngAnimate', 'ngRoute', 'app.shared', 'app.dashboard' ]);  Instead use the simple setter syntax.\n/* recommended */ angular .module('app', [ 'ngAnimate', 'ngRoute', 'app.shared', 'app.dashboard' ]);  Getters [Style Y022]  When using a module, avoid using a variable and instead use chaining with the getter syntax.  Why?: This produces more readable code and avoids variable collisions or leaks.\n/* avoid */ var app = angular.module('app'); app.controller('SomeController', SomeController); function SomeController() { }  /* recommended */ angular .module('app') .controller('SomeController', SomeController); function SomeController() { }  Setting vs Getting [Style Y023]  Only set once and get for all other instances.  Why?: A module should only be created once, then retrieved from that point and after.\n/* recommended */ // to set a module angular.module('app', []); // to get a module angular.module('app');  Named vs Anonymous Functions [Style Y024]  Use named functions instead of passing an anonymous function in as a callback.  Why?: This produces more readable code, is much easier to debug, and reduces the amount of nested callback code.\n/* avoid */ angular .module('app') .controller('DashboardController', function() { }) .factory('logger', function() { });  /* recommended */ // dashboard.js angular .module('app') .controller('DashboardController', DashboardController); function DashboardController() { }  // logger.js angular .module('app') .factory('logger', logger); function logger() { }  Back to Table of Contents\n"

	"content": " Controllers controllerAs View Syntax [Style Y030]  Use the controllerAs syntax over the classic controller with $scope syntax.  Why?: Controllers are constructed, \u0026ldquo;newed\u0026rdquo; up, and provide a single new instance, and the controllerAs syntax is closer to that of a JavaScript constructor than the classic $scope syntax.\nWhy?: It promotes the use of binding to a \u0026ldquo;dotted\u0026rdquo; object in the View (e.g. customer.name instead of name), which is more contextual, easier to read, and avoids any reference issues that may occur without \u0026ldquo;dotting\u0026rdquo;.\nWhy?: Helps avoid using $parent calls in Views with nested controllers.\n\u0026lt;!-- avoid --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div ng-controller=\u0026quot;CustomerController\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ name }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;!-- recommended --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div ng-controller=\u0026quot;CustomerController as customer\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ customer.name }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  controllerAs Controller Syntax [Style Y031]  Use the controllerAs syntax over the classic controller with $scope syntax.\n The controllerAs syntax uses this inside controllers which gets bound to $scope\n  Why?: controllerAs is syntactic sugar over $scope. You can still bind to the View and still access $scope methods.\nWhy?: Helps avoid the temptation of using $scope methods inside a controller when it may otherwise be better to avoid them or move the method to a factory, and reference them from the controller. Consider using $scope in a controller only when needed. For example when publishing and subscribing events using $emit, $broadcast, or $on.\n/* avoid */ function CustomerController($scope) { $scope.name = {}; $scope.sendMessage = function() { }; }  /* recommended - but see next section */ function CustomerController() { this.name = {}; this.sendMessage = function() { }; }  controllerAs with vm [Style Y032]  Use a capture variable for this when using the controllerAs syntax. Choose a consistent variable name such as vm, which stands for ViewModel.  Why?: The this keyword is contextual and when used within a function inside a controller may change its context. Capturing the context of this avoids encountering this problem.\n/* avoid */ function CustomerController() { this.name = {}; this.sendMessage = function() { }; }  /* recommended */ function CustomerController() { var vm = this; vm.name = {}; vm.sendMessage = function() { }; }  Note: You can avoid any jshint warnings by placing the comment above the line of code. However it is not needed when the function is named using UpperCasing, as this convention means it is a constructor function, which is what a controller is in Angular.\n/* jshint validthis: true */ var vm = this;  Note: When creating watches in a controller using controller as, you can watch the vm.* member using the following syntax. (Create watches with caution as they add more load to the digest cycle.)\n\u0026lt;input ng-model=\u0026quot;vm.title\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;  function SomeController($scope, $log) { var vm = this; vm.title = 'Some Title'; $scope.$watch('vm.title', function(current, original) { $log.info('vm.title was %s', original); $log.info('vm.title is now %s', current); }); }  Note: When working with larger codebases, using a more descriptive name can help ease cognitive overhead \u0026amp; searchability. Avoid overly verbose names that are cumbersome to type.\n\u0026lt;!-- avoid --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input ng-model=\u0026quot;customerProductItemVm.title\u0026quot;\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;!-- recommended --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input ng-model=\u0026quot;productVm.title\u0026quot;\u0026gt;  Bindable Members Up Top [Style Y033]  Place bindable members at the top of the controller, alphabetized, and not spread through the controller code.\nWhy?: Placing bindable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the controller can be bound and used in the View.\nWhy?: Setting anonymous functions in-line can be easy, but when those functions are more than 1 line of code they can reduce the readability. Defining the functions below the bindable members (the functions will be hoisted) moves the implementation details down, keeps the bindable members up top, and makes it easier to read.\n  /* avoid */ function SessionsController() { var vm = this; vm.gotoSession = function() { /* ... */ }; vm.refresh = function() { /* ... */ }; vm.search = function() { /* ... */ }; vm.sessions = []; vm.title = 'Sessions'; }  /* recommended */ function SessionsController() { var vm = this; vm.gotoSession = gotoSession; vm.refresh = refresh; vm.search = search; vm.sessions = []; vm.title = 'Sessions'; //////////// function gotoSession() { /* */ } function refresh() { /* */ } function search() { /* */ } }  ![Controller Using \u0026quot;Above the Fold\u0026quot;](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/above-the-fold-1.png)  Note: If the function is a 1 liner consider keeping it right up top, as long as readability is not affected.\n/* avoid */ function SessionsController(data) { var vm = this; vm.gotoSession = gotoSession; vm.refresh = function() { /** * lines * of * code * affects * readability */ }; vm.search = search; vm.sessions = []; vm.title = 'Sessions'; }  /* recommended */ function SessionsController(sessionDataService) { var vm = this; vm.gotoSession = gotoSession; vm.refresh = sessionDataService.refresh; // 1 liner is OK vm.search = search; vm.sessions = []; vm.title = 'Sessions'; }  Function Declarations to Hide Implementation Details [Style Y034]  Use function declarations to hide implementation details. Keep your bindable members up top. When you need to bind a function in a controller, point it to a function declaration that appears later in the file. This is tied directly to the section Bindable Members Up Top. For more details see this post.\nWhy?: Placing bindable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the controller can be bound and used in the View. (Same as above.)\nWhy?: Placing the implementation details of a function later in the file moves that complexity out of view so you can see the important stuff up top.\nWhy?: Function declarations are hoisted so there are no concerns over using a function before it is defined (as there would be with function expressions).\nWhy?: You never have to worry with function declarations that moving var a before var b will break your code because a depends on b.\nWhy?: Order is critical with function expressions\n  /** * avoid * Using function expressions. */ function AvengersController(avengersService, logger) { var vm = this; vm.avengers = []; vm.title = 'Avengers'; var activate = function() { return getAvengers().then(function() { logger.info('Activated Avengers View'); }); } var getAvengers = function() { return avengersService.getAvengers().then(function(data) { vm.avengers = data; return vm.avengers; }); } vm.getAvengers = getAvengers; activate(); }  Notice that the important stuff is scattered in the preceding example. In the example below, notice that the important stuff is up top. For example, the members bound to the controller such as vm.avengers and vm.title. The implementation details are down below. This is just easier to read.\n/* * recommend * Using function declarations * and bindable members up top. */ function AvengersController(avengersService, logger) { var vm = this; vm.avengers = []; vm.getAvengers = getAvengers; vm.title = 'Avengers'; activate(); function activate() { return getAvengers().then(function() { logger.info('Activated Avengers View'); }); } function getAvengers() { return avengersService.getAvengers().then(function(data) { vm.avengers = data; return vm.avengers; }); } }  Defer Controller Logic to Services [Style Y035]  Defer logic in a controller by delegating to services and factories.\nWhy?: Logic may be reused by multiple controllers when placed within a service and exposed via a function.\nWhy?: Logic in a service can more easily be isolated in a unit test, while the calling logic in the controller can be easily mocked.\nWhy?: Removes dependencies and hides implementation details from the controller.\nWhy?: Keeps the controller slim, trim, and focused.\n  /* avoid */ function OrderController($http, $q, config, userInfo) { var vm = this; vm.checkCredit = checkCredit; vm.isCreditOk; vm.total = 0; function checkCredit() { var settings = {}; // Get the credit service base URL from config // Set credit service required headers // Prepare URL query string or data object with request data // Add user-identifying info so service gets the right credit limit for this user. // Use JSONP for this browser if it doesn't support CORS return $http.get(settings) .then(function(data) { // Unpack JSON data in the response object // to find maxRemainingAmount vm.isCreditOk = vm.total \u0026lt;= maxRemainingAmount }) .catch(function(error) { // Interpret error // Cope w/ timeout? retry? try alternate service? // Re-reject with appropriate error for a user to see }); }; }  /* recommended */ function OrderController(creditService) { var vm = this; vm.checkCredit = checkCredit; vm.isCreditOk; vm.total = 0; function checkCredit() { return creditService.isOrderTotalOk(vm.total) .then(function(isOk) { vm.isCreditOk = isOk; }) .catch(showError); }; }  Keep Controllers Focused [Style Y037]  Define a controller for a view, and try not to reuse the controller for other views. Instead, move reusable logic to factories and keep the controller simple and focused on its view.\nWhy?: Reusing controllers with several views is brittle and good end-to-end (e2e) test coverage is required to ensure stability across large applications.\n  Assigning Controllers [Style Y038]  When a controller must be paired with a view and either component may be re-used by other controllers or views, define controllers along with their routes.\nNote: If a View is loaded via another means besides a route, then use the ng-controller=\u0026quot;Avengers as vm\u0026quot; syntax.\nWhy?: Pairing the controller in the route allows different routes to invoke different pairs of controllers and views. When controllers are assigned in the view using ng-controller, that view is always associated with the same controller.\n  /* avoid - when using with a route and dynamic pairing is desired */ // route-config.js angular .module('app') .config(config); function config($routeProvider) { $routeProvider .when('/avengers', { templateUrl: 'avengers.html' }); }  \u0026lt;!-- avengers.html --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div ng-controller=\u0026quot;AvengersController as vm\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  /* recommended */ // route-config.js angular .module('app') .config(config); function config($routeProvider) { $routeProvider .when('/avengers', { templateUrl: 'avengers.html', controller: 'Avengers', controllerAs: 'vm' }); }  \u0026lt;!-- avengers.html --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  Back to Table of Contents\n"

Defining the callable interface via the returned service moves the implementation details down, keeps the callable interface up top, and makes it easier to read.\n  /* avoid */ function dataService() { var someValue = ''; function save() { /* */ }; function validate() { /* */ }; return { save: save, someValue: someValue, validate: validate }; }  /* recommended */ function dataService() { var someValue = ''; var service = { save: save, someValue: someValue, validate: validate }; return service; //////////// function save() { /* */ }; function validate() { /* */ }; }  This way bindings are mirrored across the host object, primitive values cannot update alone using the revealing module pattern.\n![Factories Using \u0026quot;Above the Fold\u0026quot;](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/above-the-fold-2.png)  Function Declarations to Hide Implementation Details [Style Y053]  Use function declarations to hide implementation details.

	"content": " Data Services Separate Data Calls [Style Y060]  Refactor logic for making data operations and interacting with data to a factory. Make data services responsible for XHR calls, local storage, stashing in memory, or any other data operations.\nWhy?: The controller\u0026rsquo;s responsibility is for the presentation and gathering of information for the view. It should not care how it gets the data, just that it knows who to ask for it. Separating the data services moves the logic on how to get it to the data service, and lets the controller be simpler and more focused on the view.\nWhy?: This makes it easier to test (mock or real) the data calls when testing a controller that uses a data service.\nWhy?: Data service implementation may have very specific code to handle the data repository. This may include headers, how to talk to the data, or other services such as $http. Separating the logic into a data service encapsulates this logic in a single place hiding the implementation from the outside consumers (perhaps a controller), also making it easier to change the implementation.\n  /* recommended */ // dataservice factory angular .module('app.core') .factory('dataservice', dataservice); dataservice.$inject = ['$http', 'logger']; function dataservice($http, logger) { return { getAvengers: getAvengers }; function getAvengers() { return $http.get('/api/maa') .then(getAvengersComplete) .catch(getAvengersFailed); function getAvengersComplete(response) { return response.data.results; } function getAvengersFailed(error) { logger.error('XHR Failed for getAvengers.' + error.data); } } }  Note: The data service is called from consumers, such as a controller, hiding the implementation from the consumers, as shown below.  /* recommended */ // controller calling the dataservice factory angular .module('app.avengers') .controller('AvengersController', AvengersController); AvengersController.$inject = ['dataservice', 'logger']; function AvengersController(dataservice, logger) { var vm = this; vm.avengers = []; activate(); function activate() { return getAvengers().then(function() { logger.info('Activated Avengers View'); }); } function getAvengers() { return dataservice.getAvengers() .then(function(data) { vm.avengers = data; return vm.avengers; }); } }  Return a Promise from Data Calls [Style Y061]  When calling a data service that returns a promise such as $http, return a promise in your calling function too.\nWhy?: You can chain the promises together and take further action after the data call completes and resolves or rejects the promise.\n  /* recommended */ activate(); function activate() { /** * Step 1 * Ask the getAvengers function for the * avenger data and wait for the promise */ return getAvengers().then(function() { /** * Step 4 * Perform an action on resolve of final promise */ logger.info('Activated Avengers View'); }); } function getAvengers() { /** * Step 2 * Ask the data service for the data and wait * for the promise */ return dataservice.getAvengers() .then(function(data) { /** * Step 3 * set the data and resolve the promise */ vm.avengers = data; return vm.avengers; }); }  Back to Table of Contents\n"

	"content": " Directives Limit 1 Per File [Style Y070]  Create one directive per file. Name the file for the directive.\nWhy?: It is easy to mash all the directives in one file, but difficult to then break those out so some are shared across apps, some across modules, some just for one module.\nWhy?: One directive per file is easy to maintain.\n Note: \u0026ldquo;Best Practice: Directives should clean up after themselves. You can use element.on('$destroy', ...) or scope.$on('$destroy', ...) to run a clean-up function when the directive is removed\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip; from the Angular documentation.\n  /* avoid */ /* directives.js */ angular .module('app.widgets') /* order directive that is specific to the order module */ .directive('orderCalendarRange', orderCalendarRange) /* sales directive that can be used anywhere across the sales app */ .directive('salesCustomerInfo', salesCustomerInfo) /* spinner directive that can be used anywhere across apps */ .directive('sharedSpinner', sharedSpinner); function orderCalendarRange() { /* implementation details */ } function salesCustomerInfo() { /* implementation details */ } function sharedSpinner() { /* implementation details */ }  /* recommended */ /* calendar-range.directive.js */ /** * @desc order directive that is specific to the order module at a company named Acme * @example \u0026lt;div acme-order-calendar-range\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; */ angular .module('sales.order') .directive('acmeOrderCalendarRange', orderCalendarRange); function orderCalendarRange() { /* implementation details */ }  /* recommended */ /* customer-info.directive.js */ /** * @desc sales directive that can be used anywhere across the sales app at a company named Acme * @example \u0026lt;div acme-sales-customer-info\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; */ angular .module('sales.widgets') .directive('acmeSalesCustomerInfo', salesCustomerInfo); function salesCustomerInfo() { /* implementation details */ }  /* recommended */ /* spinner.directive.js */ /** * @desc spinner directive that can be used anywhere across apps at a company named Acme * @example \u0026lt;div acme-shared-spinner\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; */ angular .module('shared.widgets') .directive('acmeSharedSpinner', sharedSpinner); function sharedSpinner() { /* implementation details */ }  Note: There are many naming options for directives, especially since they can be used in narrow or wide scopes. Choose one that makes the directive and its file name distinct and clear. Some examples are below, but see the [Naming](#naming) section for more recommendations.  Manipulate DOM in a Directive [Style Y072]  When manipulating the DOM directly, use a directive. If alternative ways can be used such as using CSS to set styles or the animation services, Angular templating, ngShow or ngHide, then use those instead. For example, if the directive simply hides and shows, use ngHide/ngShow.\nWhy?: DOM manipulation can be difficult to test, debug, and there are often better ways (e.g. CSS, animations, templates)\n  Provide a Unique Directive Prefix [Style Y073]  Provide a short, unique and descriptive directive prefix such as acmeSalesCustomerInfo which would be declared in HTML as acme-sales-customer-info.\nWhy?: The unique short prefix identifies the directive\u0026rsquo;s context and origin. For example a prefix of cc- may indicate that the directive is part of a CodeCamper app while acme- may indicate a directive for the Acme company.\nNote: Avoid ng- as these are reserved for Angular directives. Research widely used directives to avoid naming conflicts, such as ion- for the Ionic Framework.\n  Restrict to Elements and Attributes [Style Y074]  When creating a directive that makes sense as a stand-alone element, allow restrict E (custom element) and optionally restrict A (custom attribute). Generally, if it could be its own control, E is appropriate. General guideline is allow EA but lean towards implementing as an element when it\u0026rsquo;s stand-alone and as an attribute when it enhances its existing DOM element.\nWhy?: It makes sense.\nWhy?: While we can allow the directive to be used as a class, if the directive is truly acting as an element it makes more sense as an element or at least as an attribute.\nNote: EA is the default for Angular 1.3 +\n  \u0026lt;!-- avoid --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;my-calendar-range\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  /* avoid */ angular .module('app.widgets') .directive('myCalendarRange', myCalendarRange); function myCalendarRange() { var directive = { link: link, templateUrl: '/template/is/located/here.html', restrict: 'C' }; return directive; function link(scope, element, attrs) { /* */ } }  \u0026lt;!-- recommended --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;my-calendar-range\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/my-calendar-range\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div my-calendar-range\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  /* recommended */ angular .module('app.widgets') .directive('myCalendarRange', myCalendarRange); function myCalendarRange() { var directive = { link: link, templateUrl: '/template/is/located/here.html', restrict: 'EA' }; return directive; function link(scope, element, attrs) { /* */ } }  Directives and ControllerAs [Style Y075]  Use controllerAs syntax with a directive to be consistent with using controller as with view and controller pairings.\nWhy?: It makes sense and it\u0026rsquo;s not difficult.\nNote: The directive below demonstrates some of the ways you can use scope inside of link and directive controllers, using controllerAs. I in-lined the template just to keep it all in one place.\nNote: Regarding dependency injection, see Manually Identify Dependencies.\nNote: Note that the directive\u0026rsquo;s controller is outside the directive\u0026rsquo;s closure. This style eliminates issues where the injection gets created as unreachable code after a return.\nNote: Life-style hooks were introduced in Angular 1.5. Initialization logic that relies on bindings being present should be put in the controller\u0026rsquo;s $onInit() method, which is guarranteed to always be called after the bindings have been assigned.\n  \u0026lt;div my-example max=\u0026quot;77\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  angular .module('app') .directive('myExample', myExample); function myExample() { var directive = { restrict: 'EA', templateUrl: 'app/feature/example.directive.html', scope: { max: '=' }, link: linkFunc, controller: ExampleController, // note: This would be 'ExampleController' (the exported controller name, as string) // if referring to a defined controller in its separate file. controllerAs: 'vm', bindToController: true // because the scope is isolated }; return directive; function linkFunc(scope, el, attr, ctrl) { console.log('LINK: scope.min = %s *** should be undefined', scope.min); console.log('LINK: scope.max = %s *** should be undefined', scope.max); console.log('LINK: scope.vm.min = %s', scope.vm.min); console.log('LINK: scope.vm.max = %s', scope.vm.max); } } ExampleController.$inject = ['$scope']; function ExampleController($scope) { // Injecting $scope just for comparison var vm = this; vm.min = 3; vm.$onInit = onInit; ////////// console.log('CTRL: $scope.vm.min = %s', $scope.vm.min); console.log('CTRL: $scope.vm.max = %s', $scope.vm.max); // undefined in Angular 1.5+ console.log('CTRL: vm.min = %s', vm.min); console.log('CTRL: vm.max = %s', vm.max); // undefined in Angular 1.5+ // Angular 1.5+ does not bind attributes until calling $onInit(); function onInit() { console.log('CTRL-onInit: $scope.vm.min = %s', $scope.vm.min); console.log('CTRL-onInit: $scope.vm.max = %s', $scope.vm.max); console.log('CTRL-onInit: vm.min = %s', vm.min); console.log('CTRL-onInit: vm.max = %s', vm.max); } }  \u0026lt;!-- example.directive.html --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;hello world\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;max={{vm.max}}\u0026lt;input ng-model=\u0026quot;vm.max\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;min={{vm.min}}\u0026lt;input ng-model=\u0026quot;vm.min\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  Note: You can also name the controller when you inject it into the link function and access directive attributes as properties of the controller.  // Alternative to above example function linkFunc(scope, el, attr, vm) { console.log('LINK: scope.min = %s *** should be undefined', scope.min); console.log('LINK: scope.max = %s *** should be undefined', scope.max); console.log('LINK: vm.min = %s', vm.min); console.log('LINK: vm.max = %s', vm.max); }  [Style Y076]  Use bindToController = true when using controller as syntax with a directive when you want to bind the outer scope to the directive\u0026rsquo;s controller\u0026rsquo;s scope.\nWhy?: It makes it easy to bind outer scope to the directive\u0026rsquo;s controller scope.\nNote: bindToController was introduced in Angular 1.3.0.\n  \u0026lt;div my-example max=\u0026quot;77\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  angular .module('app') .directive('myExample', myExample); function myExample() { var directive = { restrict: 'EA', templateUrl: 'app/feature/example.directive.html', scope: { max: '=' }, controller: ExampleController, controllerAs: 'vm', bindToController: true }; return directive; } function ExampleController() { var vm = this; vm.min = 3; vm.$onInit = onInit; function onInit() = { console.log('CTRL: vm.min = %s', vm.min); console.log('CTRL: vm.max = %s', vm.max); } }  \u0026lt;!-- example.directive.html --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;hello world\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;max={{vm.max}}\u0026lt;input ng-model=\u0026quot;vm.max\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;min={{vm.min}}\u0026lt;input ng-model=\u0026quot;vm.min\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  Back to Table of Contents\n"

	"content": " Resolving Promises Controller Activation Promises [Style Y080]  Resolve start-up logic for a controller in an activate function.\nWhy?: Placing start-up logic in a consistent place in the controller makes it easier to locate, more consistent to test, and helps avoid spreading out the activation logic across the controller.\nWhy?: The controller activate makes it convenient to re-use the logic for a refresh for the controller/View, keeps the logic together, gets the user to the View faster, makes animations easy on the ng-view or ui-view, and feels snappier to the user.\nNote: If you need to conditionally cancel the route before you start using the controller, use a route resolve instead.\n  /* avoid */ function AvengersController(dataservice) { var vm = this; vm.avengers = []; vm.title = 'Avengers'; dataservice.getAvengers().then(function(data) { vm.avengers = data; return vm.avengers; }); }  /* recommended */ function AvengersController(dataservice) { var vm = this; vm.avengers = []; vm.title = 'Avengers'; activate(); //////////// function activate() { return dataservice.getAvengers().then(function(data) { vm.avengers = data; return vm.avengers; }); } }  Route Resolve Promises [Style Y081]  When a controller depends on a promise to be resolved before the controller is activated, resolve those dependencies in the $routeProvider before the controller logic is executed. If you need to conditionally cancel a route before the controller is activated, use a route resolver.\n Use a route resolve when you want to decide to cancel the route before ever transitioning to the View.\nWhy?: A controller may require data before it loads. That data may come from a promise via a custom factory or $http. Using a route resolve allows the promise to resolve before the controller logic executes, so it might take action based on that data from the promise.\nWhy?: The code executes after the route and in the controller’s activate function. The View starts to load right away. Data binding kicks in when the activate promise resolves. A “busy” animation can be shown during the view transition (via ng-view or ui-view)\nNote: The code executes before the route via a promise. Rejecting the promise cancels the route. Resolve makes the new view wait for the route to resolve. A “busy” animation can be shown before the resolve and through the view transition. If you want to get to the View faster and do not require a checkpoint to decide if you can get to the View, consider the controller activate technique instead.\n  /* avoid */ angular .module('app') .controller('AvengersController', AvengersController); function AvengersController(movieService) { var vm = this; // unresolved vm.movies; // resolved asynchronously movieService.getMovies().then(function(response) { vm.movies = response.movies; }); }  /* better */ // route-config.js angular .module('app') .config(config); function config($routeProvider) { $routeProvider .when('/avengers', { templateUrl: 'avengers.html', controller: 'AvengersController', controllerAs: 'vm', resolve: { moviesPrepService: function(movieService) { return movieService.getMovies(); } } }); } // avengers.js angular .module('app') .controller('AvengersController', AvengersController); AvengersController.$inject = ['moviesPrepService']; function AvengersController(moviesPrepService) { var vm = this; vm.movies = moviesPrepService.movies; }  Note: The example below shows the route resolve points to a named function, which is easier to debug and easier to handle dependency injection.  /* even better */ // route-config.js angular .module('app') .config(config); function config($routeProvider) { $routeProvider .when('/avengers', { templateUrl: 'avengers.html', controller: 'AvengersController', controllerAs: 'vm', resolve: { moviesPrepService: moviesPrepService } }); } function moviesPrepService(movieService) { return movieService.getMovies(); } // avengers.js angular .module('app') .controller('AvengersController', AvengersController); AvengersController.$inject = ['moviesPrepService']; function AvengersController(moviesPrepService) { var vm = this; vm.movies = moviesPrepService.movies; }  Note: The code example's dependency on `movieService` is not minification safe on its own.

Back to top\nHandling Exceptions with Promises [Style Y082]  The catch block of a promise must return a rejected promise to maintain the exception in the promise chain.\n Always handle exceptions in services/factories.\nWhy?: If the catch block does not return a rejected promise, the caller of the promise will not know an exception occurred. The caller\u0026rsquo;s then will execute. Thus, the user may never know what happened.\nWhy?: To avoid swallowing errors and misinforming the user.\nNote: Consider putting any exception handling in a function in a shared module and service.\n  /* avoid */ function getCustomer(id) { return $http.get('/api/customer/' + id) .then(getCustomerComplete) .catch(getCustomerFailed); function getCustomerComplete(data, status, headers, config) { return data.data; } function getCustomerFailed(e) { var newMessage = 'XHR Failed for getCustomer' if (e.data \u0026amp;\u0026amp; e.data.description) { newMessage = newMessage + '\\n' + e.data.description; } e.data.description = newMessage; logger.error(newMessage); // *** // Notice there is no return of the rejected promise // *** } }  /* recommended */ function getCustomer(id) { return $http.get('/api/customer/' + id) .then(getCustomerComplete) .catch(getCustomerFailed); function getCustomerComplete(data, status, headers, config) { return data.data; } function getCustomerFailed(e) { var newMessage = 'XHR Failed for getCustomer' if (e.data \u0026amp;\u0026amp; e.data.description) { newMessage = newMessage + '\\n' + e.data.description; } e.data.description = newMessage; logger.error(newMessage); return $q.reject(e); } }  Back to Table of Contents\n"

A descriptive folder structure can help with this.\n/bower_components /client /app /avengers /blocks /exception /logger /core /dashboard /data /layout /widgets /content index.html .bower.json   Identify [Style Y142]  When you look at a file you should instantly know what it contains and represents.\nWhy?: You spend less time hunting and pecking for code, and become more efficient. If this means you want longer file names, then so be it. Be descriptive with file names and keeping the contents of the file to exactly 1 component. Avoid files with multiple controllers, multiple services, or a mixture. There are deviations of the 1 per file rule when I have a set of very small features that are all related to each other, they are still easily identifiable.\n  Flat [Style Y143]  Keep a flat folder structure as long as possible. When you get to 7+ files, begin considering separation.\nWhy?: Nobody wants to search 7 levels of folders to find a file. Think about menus on web sites … anything deeper than 2 should take serious consideration. In a folder structure there is no hard and fast number rule, but when a folder has 7-10 files, that may be time to create subfolders. Base it on your comfort level. Use a flatter structure until there is an obvious value (to help the rest of LIFT) in creating a new folder.\n  T-DRY (Try to Stick to DRY) [Style Y144]  Be DRY, but don\u0026rsquo;t go nuts and sacrifice readability.\nWhy?: Being DRY is important, but not crucial if it sacrifices the others in LIFT, which is why I call it T-DRY. I don’t want to type session-view.html for a view because, well, it’s obviously a view. If it is not obvious or by convention, then I name it.\n  Back to Table of Contents\n"

	"content": " Application Structure Overall Guidelines [Style Y150]  Have a near term view of implementation and a long term vision. In other words, start small but keep in mind on where the app is heading down the road. All of the app\u0026rsquo;s code goes in a root folder named app. All content is 1 feature per file. Each controller, service, module, view is in its own file. All 3rd party vendor scripts are stored in another root folder and not in the app folder. I didn\u0026rsquo;t write them and I don\u0026rsquo;t want them cluttering my app (bower_components, scripts, lib).\nNote: Find more details and reasoning behind the structure at this original post on application structure.\n  Layout [Style Y151]  Place components that define the overall layout of the application in a folder named layout. These may include a shell view and controller may act as the container for the app, navigation, menus, content areas, and other regions.\nWhy?: Organizes all layout in a single place re-used throughout the application.\n  Folders-by-Feature Structure [Style Y152]  Create folders named for the feature they represent. When a folder grows to contain more than 7 files, start to consider creating a folder for them. Your threshold may be different, so adjust as needed.\nWhy?: A developer can locate the code, identify what each file represents at a glance, the structure is flat as can be, and there is no repetitive nor redundant names.\nWhy?: The LIFT guidelines are all covered.\nWhy?: Helps reduce the app from becoming cluttered through organizing the content and keeping them aligned with the LIFT guidelines.\nWhy?: When there are a lot of files (10+) locating them is easier with a consistent folder structures and more difficult in flat structures.\n```javascript /**\n recommended */  app/ app.module.js app.config.js components/ calendar.directive.js calendar.directive.html user-profile.directive.js user-profile.directive.html layout/ shell.html shell.controller.js topnav.html topnav.controller.js people/ attendees.html attendees.controller.js people.routes.js speakers.html speakers.controller.js speaker-detail.html speaker-detail.controller.js services/ data.service.js localstorage.service.js logger.service.js spinner.service.js sessions/ sessions.html sessions.controller.js sessions.routes.js session-detail.html session-detail.controller.js\n ![Sample App Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/modularity-2.png) Note: Do not structure your app using folders-by-type. This requires moving to multiple folders when working on a feature and gets unwieldy quickly as the app grows to 5, 10 or 25+ views and controllers (and other features), which makes it more difficult than folder-by-feature to locate files. ```javascript /* * avoid * Alternative folders-by-type. * I recommend \u0026quot;folders-by-feature\u0026quot;, instead. */ app/ app.module.js app.config.js app.routes.js directives.js controllers/ attendees.js session-detail.js sessions.js shell.js speakers.js speaker-detail.js topnav.js directives/ calendar.directive.js calendar.directive.html user-profile.directive.js user-profile.directive.html services/ dataservice.js localstorage.js logger.js spinner.js views/ attendees.html session-detail.html sessions.html shell.html speakers.html speaker-detail.html topnav.html   Back to Table of Contents\n"

	"title": "Modularity",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " Modularity Many Small, Self Contained Modules [Style Y160]  Create small modules that encapsulate one responsibility.\nWhy?: Modular applications make it easy to plug and go as they allow the development teams to build vertical slices of the applications and roll out incrementally. This means we can plug in new features as we develop them.\n  Create an App Module [Style Y161]  Create an application root module whose role is to pull together all of the modules and features of your application. Name this for your application.\nWhy?: Angular encourages modularity and separation patterns. Creating an application root module whose role is to tie your other modules together provides a very straightforward way to add or remove modules from your application.\n  Keep the App Module Thin [Style Y162]  Only put logic for pulling together the app in the application module. Leave features in their own modules.\nWhy?: Adding additional roles to the application root to get remote data, display views, or other logic not related to pulling the app together muddies the app module and make both sets of features harder to reuse or turn off.\nWhy?: The app module becomes a manifest that describes which modules help define the application.\n  Feature Areas are Modules [Style Y163]  Create modules that represent feature areas, such as layout, reusable and shared services, dashboards, and app specific features (e.g. customers, admin, sales).\nWhy?: Self contained modules can be added to the application with little or no friction.\nWhy?: Sprints or iterations can focus on feature areas and turn them on at the end of the sprint or iteration.\nWhy?: Separating feature areas into modules makes it easier to test the modules in isolation and reuse code.\n  Reusable Blocks are Modules [Style Y164]  Create modules that represent reusable application blocks for common services such as exception handling, logging, diagnostics, security, and local data stashing.\nWhy?: These types of features are needed in many applications, so by keeping them separated in their own modules they can be application generic and be reused across applications.\n  Module Dependencies [Style Y165]  The application root module depends on the app specific feature modules and any shared or reusable modules.\nWhy?: The main app module contains a quickly identifiable manifest of the application\u0026rsquo;s features.\nWhy?: Each feature area contains a manifest of what it depends on, so it can be pulled in as a dependency in other applications and still work.\nWhy?: Intra-App features such as shared data services become easy to locate and share from within app.core (choose your favorite name for this module).\nNote: This is a strategy for consistency. There are many good options here. Choose one that is consistent, follows Angular\u0026rsquo;s dependency rules, and is easy to maintain and scale.\n My structures vary slightly between projects but they all follow these guidelines for structure and modularity. The implementation may vary depending on the features and the team. In other words, don\u0026rsquo;t get hung up on an exact like-for-like structure but do justify your structure using consistency, maintainability, and efficiency in mind.\nIn a small app, you can also consider putting all the shared dependencies in the app module where the feature modules have no direct dependencies. This makes it easier to maintain the smaller application, but makes it harder to reuse modules outside of this application.\n  Back to Table of Contents\n"

Placing in a factory makes it easier to abstract and mock.\nWhy?: Code directly in a run block can cause race conditions for startup logic, as it does not have a way to communicate when asynchronous code in the run block has completed.\n  angular .module('app') .run(runBlock); runBlock.$inject = ['authenticator', 'translator']; function runBlock(authenticator, translator) { authenticator.initialize(); translator.initialize(); }  Back to Table of Contents\n"

Start with an empty test and fill them in as you write the code for the story.\nWhy?: Writing the test descriptions helps clearly define what your story will do, will not do, and how you can measure success.\nit('should have Avengers controller', function() { // TODO }); it('should find 1 Avenger when filtered by name', function() { // TODO }); it('should have 10 Avengers', function() { // TODO (mock data?) }); it('should return Avengers via XHR', function() { // TODO ($httpBackend?) }); // and so on   Testing Library [Style Y191]  Use Jasmine or Mocha for unit testing.\nWhy?: Both Jasmine and Mocha are widely used in the Angular community. Both are stable, well maintained, and provide robust testing features.\nNote: When using Mocha, also consider choosing an assert library such as Chai. I prefer Mocha.\n  Test Runner [Style Y192]  Use Karma as a test runner.\nWhy?: Karma is easy to configure to run once or automatically when you change your code.\nWhy?: Karma hooks into your Continuous Integration process easily on its own or through Grunt or Gulp.\nWhy?: Some IDE\u0026rsquo;s are beginning to integrate with Karma, such as WebStorm and Visual Studio.\nWhy?: Karma works well with task automation leaders such as Grunt (with grunt-karma) and Gulp. When using Gulp, use Karma directly and not with a plugin as the API can be called directly.\n/* recommended */ // Gulp example with Karma directly function startTests(singleRun, done) { var child; var excludeFiles = []; var fork = require('child_process').fork; var Server = require('karma').Server; var serverSpecs = config.serverIntegrationSpecs; if (args.startServers) { log('Starting servers'); var savedEnv = process.env; savedEnv.NODE_ENV = 'dev'; savedEnv.PORT = 8888; child = fork(config.nodeServer); } else { if (serverSpecs \u0026amp;\u0026amp; serverSpecs.length) { excludeFiles = serverSpecs; } } var karmaOptions = { configFile: __dirname + '/karma.conf.js', exclude: excludeFiles, singleRun: !!singleRun }; let server = new Server(karmaOptions, karmaCompleted); server.start(); //////////////// function karmaCompleted(karmaResult) { log('Karma completed'); if (child) { log('shutting down the child process'); child.kill(); } if (karmaResult === 1) { done('karma: tests failed with code ' + karmaResult); } else { done(); } } }   Stubbing and Spying [Style Y193]  Use Sinon for stubbing and spying.\nWhy?: Sinon works well with both Jasmine and Mocha and extends the stubbing and spying features they offer.\nWhy?: Sinon makes it easier to toggle between Jasmine and Mocha, if you want to try both.\nWhy?: Sinon has descriptive messages when tests fail the assertions.\n  Headless Browser [Style Y194]  Use PhantomJS to run your tests on a server.\nWhy?: PhantomJS is a headless browser that helps run your tests without needing a \u0026ldquo;visual\u0026rdquo; browser. So you do not have to install Chrome, Safari, IE, or other browsers on your server.\nNote: You should still test on all browsers in your environment, as appropriate for your target audience.\n  Code Analysis [Style Y195]  Run JSHint on your tests.\nWhy?: Tests are code. JSHint can help identify code quality issues that may cause the test to work improperly.\n  Alleviate Globals for JSHint Rules on Tests [Style Y196]  Relax the rules on your test code to allow for common globals such as describe and expect. Relax the rules for expressions, as Mocha uses these.\nWhy?: Your tests are code and require the same attention and code quality rules as all of your production code. However, global variables used by the testing framework, for example, can be relaxed by including this in your test specs.\n/* jshint -W117, -W030 */  Or you can add the following to your JSHint Options file.\n\u0026quot;jasmine\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;mocha\u0026quot;: true,   Organizing Tests [Style Y197]  Place unit test files (specs) side-by-side with your client code. Place specs that cover server integration or test multiple components in a separate tests folder.\nWhy?: Unit tests have a direct correlation to a specific component and file in source code.\nWhy?: It is easier to keep them up to date since they are always in sight. When coding whether you do TDD or test during development or test after development, the specs are side-by-side and never out of sight nor mind, and thus more likely to be maintained which also helps maintain code coverage.\nWhy?: When you update source code it is easier to go update the tests at the same time.\nWhy?: Placing them side-by-side makes it easy to find them and easy to move them with the source code if you move the source.\nWhy?: Having the spec nearby makes it easier for the source code reader to learn how the component is supposed to be used and to discover its known limitations.\nWhy?: Separating specs so they are not in a distributed build is easy with grunt or gulp.\n/src/client/app/customers/customer-detail.controller.js /customer-detail.controller.spec.js /customers.controller.js /customers.controller.spec.js /customers.module.js /customers.route.js /customers.route.spec.js   Back to Table of Contents\n"

When constants are used only for a module that may be reused in multiple applications, place constants in a file per module named after the module.

For example, a url for a data service could be placed in a constants but a better place would be to load it from a web service.\nWhy?: Constants can be injected into any angular component, including providers.\nWhy?: When an application is separated into modules that may be reused in other applications, each stand-alone module should be able to operate on its own including any dependent constants.\n// Constants used by the entire app angular .module('app.core') .constant('moment', moment); // Constants used only by the sales module angular .module('app.sales') .constant('events', { ORDER_CREATED: 'event_order_created', INVENTORY_DEPLETED: 'event_inventory_depleted' });   Back to Table of Contents\n"
